# ETL-Project
Demostrate extract, transform, load of LA crime data csv files using Pandas(transform) and PostgreSQL(load)
Summarized project in word document to illustrate project steps and results.

Extract
We found two csv files on Kaggle.com after researching through both Kaggle and Data.gov. For our topic we chose crime because we were able to use the DR Number as our primary key (column). After looking through the datasets for a while and trying to find data from different sources, we had to settle for two csv files that both included the DR Number. The first csv file is traffic data from Los Angeles and the second csv file is crime data from Los Angeles. We downloaded and saved both files onto our local directories and prepared for transformation.
